        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Gerbeaud slice or zserbó is named after the world-famous confectionery, 
               Café Gerbeaud, which is situated at Vörösmarty square 7 in Budapest.
               It’s one of the greatest and most traditional café-confectioneries in Europe.
               The legend of Gerbeaud began with Henrik Kugler who was the third child of a
               confectionery dynasty.
            <p>He opened his confectionery in 1858 at József Nádor square.
               This was the first place where ice cream creations were available. In order to be
               closer to the city center, Kugler in 1870 moved the store to Vörösmarty square.
               His coffees, liqueurs and sweets attracted the audience, mignons and Kugler cakes
               had a good market since it was possible to take them home, wrapped on a paper tray.</p>
